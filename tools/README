The USB boot tool is used to program the NAND flash, download firmware to the
target board to execute, and test your hardware problems etc. It can also be
used to upgrade the code and data of your product.

The tool package includes these files:

USB_Boot.exe: an executable file, you can run the commands of the tools after executing it.
fw.bin: a binary file used to initialize the hardware of the board.
usb_boot.bin: a binary file used to perform the NAND programming and hardware test functionality.
Usb_Boot_Driver.sys: the driver file used for Windows 2000/XP/Vista.
Usb_Boot_Driver.inf: the driver information file.
USBBoot.cfg: the configuration file used by the USB boot tool.
USBBoot_BOARD.cfg: example configuration files for various boards.

First of all, you should install the driver when you boot the device from USB for the first time.

Then click USB_Boot.exe to start the tool. It's a command line tool, type 'help' to get all the
supported commands. More help can be found in the <USB_Boot_Tool_Manual.pdf>.

Before starting, you should open the USBBoot.cfg file to check the configuration values and
be sure that it's correct for your target board.

Then copy the file that you want to program to the tools\ directory.

Following are simple steps to program the NAND flash:

USBBoot :> boot 0
...
Boot success!
...
Configure success!

USBBoot :> nquery 0 0

ID of No.0 device No.0 flash:
Vendor ID  :0xec
Product ID :0xd5
Chip ID    :0x14
Page ID    :0xb6
Plane ID   :0x74
Operation status: Success!

USBBoot :> nprog 0 u-boot-nand.bin 0 0 -n

Programming No.0 device...
Erasing No.0 device No.0 flash...... Finish!
Operation end position: 2
Force erase, no bad block information!
Total size to send in byte is: 471296
Image type: without oob
It will cause 2 times buffer transfer.
No.1 Programming... Finish! Checking...pass! End at 128
No.2 Programming... Finish! Checking...pass! End at 231
